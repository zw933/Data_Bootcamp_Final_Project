Project Description: 

Over the past few decades, growth in US per-capita healthcare expenditures has outpaced inflation, and it has grown from [5% of GDP in 1960 to 17.8%, as of 2015](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/Tables.zip). Consequently, controlling cost growth is a priority for all stakeholders, political and otherwise. Often, decision-makers focus on specific initiatives, and few have objectively demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the health expenditures growth. Thus, this project aims to re-examine and narrate what has happened to the spending growth across the entire healthcare system at the national level: who has paid for the growth in spending and what has it been spent that money on. Specifically, the project hopes to With this information, leaders can better prioritize their  agenda.
